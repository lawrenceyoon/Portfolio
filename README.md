# My Portfolio

## Context
My portfolio to showcase my projects and experience. I built my website using vanilla JS to show I don't need a framework or library. For CSS, I added styles from scratch; nothing was used except a CSS reset (Meyers).

## Intention
I love using a minimalistic approach - a simple website showing others exactly what they need to see.
