# My Portfolio

Made using HTML, CSS, and jQuery

My responsive portfolio was made to showcase HTML, CSS & jQuery skills without using any frameworks and making a site responsive using only a simple grid system (http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/).

Please feel free to check out my other demo Jekyll portfolio as well, using Jekyll (a static site generator) and Bootstrap 4 as a framework. No themes were used, the demo was built purely from sratch. Both were made to show that I understand the underlying core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JS and can incorporate a framework if needed.
